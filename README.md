# RFID-Arduino
Microprocessors and controllers project 
We have used arduino and an RFID module together to implement a smart lock system. Our code will save a certain RFID chip card as the authorized
one and then upon swiping the card it will detect if the holder has authorized access or not. Upon checking it will display access status 
on serial monitor. A servo motor is used to open the lock if authorized access is detected.
